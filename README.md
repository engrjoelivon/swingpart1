I tried to explain in details,swing in java.This project covers swing from the basic perspective to the advanced level.
Every package contains a readme.txt file,this describes all the classes within the package and how they are connected with one 
another.In some packages i have errors.txt file,in there i listed some of the simple errors i encountered.
