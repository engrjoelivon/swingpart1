                 To Create A basic java swing
  Create an instance of Jpanel by default it is invisible so call setVisble(true)
  Call setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE) this method will ensure it closes when you click in the close sign
  Call setSize() to give it a dimension.
  Most java swing might have to perform some operation that might delay,e.g reading from a source
that means it will be better to have a swing in a thread.The swingUtilites can easily do that.call
SwingUtilities.invokeLater() and passing in a runnable.Within the run,run method of the runnable declare the swing
codes.
