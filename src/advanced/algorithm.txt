This package focuses on advanced ways to create communications between panels in a GUI applications.
        Create a controller class(Controllerframe.java) to control all activity in the GUI.
        define all related activities in seperate panels.
        create a class that extends eventObject to temporarily hold instance of datas to be transferred.The construction must define an object as a parameter so that it can be passed to super.
        Define an interface(EventListener.java) to act as a bridge between the panels and the controller class.
        
When the application starts,the JFRAME constructor get invoked,it sets up every instance of the panel class,
then calls a method defined from the Formevent class,passing in an anonymous class for eventlistener interface.
Within this interface the eventOccured method is overridden,appropriate getters methods for the formevent class 
is invoked and passed to the DisplayPanel class method displaytext.
    Execution moves to the FormPanel Class formEventlistener() this method then stores an eventlistener variable recieved 
from the invocation as a field variable for this class.
    Execution moves back to the Controller class then create the GUI based on the set parameters.
When a button is pressed execution immediately moves into the actionPerformed method of the formPanel class.The textFields are stripped off the text 
contain.These parameters are then used to create a new formEvent Object.A check is performed to ensure that the eventListener variable defined,is not 
null,if false this variable is used to invoke its eventOccured method and the formEvent instance created earlier is passed into it as a parameter.
Remember earlier that this eventListner is the same one passed in from the controller class.
Execution now moves into the eventOccured method,invoking all the methods as defined in the anonymous class passed in by the controller class.
    I added a Jcombo box to the formpanel class,because of this the laymanager is getting too bulky,i had to move it to a different method.
To send the itemselected from the Jcombo,it can be done exactly as a JList,but take note of the fact that Jcombo is editable,bacause 
if the user edits an item,then it will not match the id.To curb this i created a private class that defines instances for the jcombo items ie an id and a name
 I added radio buttons and checkbuttons,the example is self explanatory.
 Next i added a Jmenubar,jfilechooser and jfilechooserfilter.
   I created a prefdialog class,this class extends the Jdialog component.for jdialog component to be visible call its setvisible method.
